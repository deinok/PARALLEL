## Analysis of the chosen benchmark

### BT
BT is a structured grid benchmark that solves a synthetic system of nonlinear partial differential equations.
It represents implicit finite-difference applications, commonly found in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
The computation involves solving block tridiagonal systems at each grid level.
The computation is dominated by communication between neighboring processes, leading to a high communication overhead.
It uses coarse-grain parallelism, where large blocks of data are assigned to different processors.
The main challenge is synchronization, as processes need to communicate frequently to exchange boundary data.
The memory access pattern is regular, with structured accesses to large matrices.

### IS
IS is based on the bucket sort algorithm, which is used to sort a list of randomly generated integers.
It measures the performance of integer sorting, which is crucial for applications like databases, cryptography, and data analytics.
The benchmark is memory-access intensive rather than compute-intensive.

## Description of the machine to compare
Moore is an homogeneous Cluster with a total of 32 processing units and 32GB of main memory, distributed over 8 nodes with an Intel Core i5 processor with 4 cores at 3.1 GHz and 4GB of main memory.

The Moore cluster is best classified as a Distributed Memory Architecture rather than a Shared Memory or Hybrid system.
In a distributed memory system, each processor or node has its own local memory, and processors must communicate using message passing (e.g., MPI - Message Passing Interface).
Mooreâ€™s 8 nodes each have separate memory pools, meaning they must use network-based communication to share data.
This aligns with the Distributed Memory Architecture model.
