## Analysis of the chosen benchmark

### BT
BT is a structured grid benchmark that solves a synthetic system of nonlinear partial differential equations.
It represents implicit finite-difference applications, commonly found in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
The computation involves solving block tridiagonal systems at each grid level.
The computation is dominated by communication between neighboring processes, leading to a high communication overhead.
It uses coarse-grain parallelism, where large blocks of data are assigned to different processors.
The main challenge is synchronization, as processes need to communicate frequently to exchange boundary data.
The memory access pattern is regular, with structured accesses to large matrices.

### FT
FT is based on 3D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is a spectral method for solving partial differential equations.
It focuses on floating-point intensive operations, making it useful for evaluating the computational performance of parallel systems.
FT requires global communication due to the nature of FFT operations.
The major challenge is all-to-all communication, where data needs to be exchanged between all processors.
Memory access patterns are less regular compared to BT due to the data transpositions required in FFT computations.
It is compute-intensive but can be limited by communication bottlenecks.

## Description of the machine to compare
Moore is an homogeneous Cluster with a total of 32 processing units and 32GB of main memory, distributed over 8 nodes with an Intel Core i5 processor with 4 cores at 3.1 GHz and 4GB of main memory.

The Moore cluster is best classified as a Distributed Memory Architecture rather than a Shared Memory or Hybrid system.
In a distributed memory system, each processor or node has its own local memory, and processors must communicate using message passing (e.g., MPI - Message Passing Interface).
Mooreâ€™s 8 nodes each have separate memory pools, meaning they must use network-based communication to share data.
This aligns with the Distributed Memory Architecture model.
